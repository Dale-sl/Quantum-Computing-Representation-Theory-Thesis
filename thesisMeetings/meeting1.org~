* quantum problems
** dihedral hidden subgroup
  get the lay of the land first in hidden subgroup problems; what's solved, not solved.
  Bacon Childs and Van Damne survey article, optimal measurements for the dihedral hidden subgroup problem
  (2007)
  ideas on how to chip away at this problem
  shakeel asif thesis, showed better initial character query
  extremely hard problem
** finite group of unitary matrices
   Easier problem.
   teacher chooses one of the unitary matricies, want to determine which has been chosen.
   choose any input vector, get back the unitary matrix acting on that vector.
   Connected this problem with the representation theory of finite group.
   more general problem, coset identification.
   someone chooses permutation of n elements, want you to identify which permuation was chosen.
   can evaluate the permutation on any single element.
   other problem, unknown permutation, want to know if permutation is even or odd.
   needs lot of represntation theory to do this.
   any group, group action, or homomorphism has a quantum analog. If you understand representation well
   enough, you can answer this problem.
   Hasn't been done for the general linear group.
   a representation is a homomorphism to invertible matricies.
   If you have a finite group, there is only a finite way of representing them up to irreducibility.
   email me daniel and jamie's 2 papers.
   Pommershiem and copeland; two papers called quantum query complexity
   mark zhandry, wrote some overlap with daniel paper? interested in abelian groups.
   
* base paper
** need to know
   Wreath product (with product action?), irreducible character, permutation character,
   weird generating set with character and homomorphism --> actually this -->V
   standard scalar product of complex valued class functions
   sign character is relevant to previous work
   orbit-counting lemma (burnsides lemma)
* Things to include in introduction
  wreath products certainly
  representation theory;
  certainly characters, basic definitions from representation theory,
  theorems we end up using.
  Remind readers of algebra definitions informally and quickly.

* regular orbit
  regular orbit is an orbit where each element has trival pointwise stabilizer,
  sufficent to say one element has trivial pointwise stabilizer
  rewrite lemma 2.2 as a proof at a undergraduate level
  finding a regular orbit in the l-tuple of your set implies theres a
  l-element subset of the set which has trivial pointwise stabilizer
  We can find the size of the base, but does this help us compute what the base is?

  Try to see if people have tried to do representation theory of permutations of b partitions
  into sets of size a; use GAP to generate these representations, then we can use the
  resulting young tableux to make conjectures about the representations and thus
  the quantum query complexity.
  try to find nonstandard actions of S_n and we can answer quantum questions about them;
  actions where base size is known already?
  What i have to do: find the representation of this partition action, then use GAP to
  find the irreducible representations corresponding to this representation,
  then take increasing tensor products and again look at the irreducible representations.
  Try to find a pattern in the irreducible representations.
